Here is a list of Health Records, based on FHIR&amp;rsquo;s specifications:
Name Definition Diagnostic Report Record The Clinical Artifact represents diagnostic reports including Radiology and Laboratory reports that can be shared across the health ecosystem. Discharge Summary Record Clinical document used to represent the discharge summary record for ABDM HDE data set.</description></item><item><title>Understand Care Context</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/understand-care-context/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 04:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/understand-care-context/index.html</guid><description>Understand Care Context The idea of Care Context is to create a logical bundle of the health records. Each HMIS/LMIS system must decide how they want to organise data in care context.
Our recommendations:
One care context for every outpatient visit &amp;amp; 1 care context for inpatient visit. Every care context has a reference ID, and a display name. The reference ID is internal to the hmis/lmis system &amp;amp; must be used to identify the set of health records associated with the care context.</description></item><item><title>Link Care Context</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/link-care-context/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 04:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/link-care-context/index.html</guid><description>Link Care Context This section covers: HIP Initiated linking Notification to Mobile Discovery &amp;amp; Link</description></item><item><title>Understanding Consents</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/understanding-consents/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 05:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/understanding-consents/index.html</guid><description>Understanding Consents ABDM design is aligned with India&amp;rsquo;s Personal Data Protection Bill, that is the exchange of health data can only happen with the consent of the User.
The entity requesting access to the data (HIU), needs to provide the following information:
The purpose for which they want access to data The historical time period of health data The type of health records How long they wish to keep a copy the data ABDM uses an electronic consent artefact based on MEITY&amp;rsquo;s electronic consent framework to allow HIUs to specify their consent request.</description></item><item><title>Store Consent Artefacts</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/store-consent-artefacts/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 12:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/store-consent-artefacts/index.html</guid><description>Store Consent Artefacts Users have the option to revoke the consent they have provided to the Health Information User (HIU), at any time. The HIUs must remove any copy of the users&amp;rsquo; data when the consent is revoked.
All Health Information Providers (HIPs) who are holding any data associated with this consent are notified. They must save a copy of the consent artefact in their system. Data can be shared against this consent any number of times till the consent expires (or is revoked by the user).</description></item><item><title>Request Health Records</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/request-health-records/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 05:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/request-health-records/index.html</guid><description>Request Health Records The data request and transfer process between the HIU, CM and HIP passes through the following three stages:
First Stage
The HIU system for patient’s health information to the HIP, through the CM against a valid granted consent.
The CM assigns a transaction ID for the entire data flow and communicates this Id to the health repositories of the HIU and the HIP.
The HIU’s health repository embeds three key elements within the health information request:</description></item><item><title>Packaging Health Data</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/packaging-health-data/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 05:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/packaging-health-data/index.html</guid><description>Packaging Health Data This section helps you understand data packaging, what goes into the main envelope, types of health information and much more. The examples provided in this section only explain the syntactic means of the data formats. For expressing symantec meaning via standards, encoding and terminologies please refer to the CDAC NRCeS website or as recommended by NHA.

You will need to use an FHIR client library to code the JSON samples provided in the sections below.</description></item><item><title>Encryption &amp; Decryption</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/encryption-decryption/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 05:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/encryption-decryption/index.html</guid><description>Encryption and Decryption The aim of encryption is to ensure that only the party (HIU) that has been granted consent by the user (or patient) is able to access the health data information of the user.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a high level overview on how the process of encyption and decryption works between HIUs and the HIPs, with the consent of the patient:
Every Health Information User (HIU) has 2 keys; that is public &amp;amp; private key.</description></item><item><title>Transferring Health Data</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/transfer-health-data/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 05:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/transfer-health-data/index.html</guid><description>Transferring Health Data Firewall Rules DataPush URL - can be any URL specified by the HIU. The HRP system must ensure that its firewall rules are setup in such a way that the outbound HTTPs requests can be to any URL
Security is ensured by making sure that the encrypted data can be only decrypted by requesting HIU
Posting the Data The encrypted data must be pushed to the HIU by the HRP within a short time frame.</description></item></channel></rss>
