When a new health record is created for the patient, it needs to be linked to the ABHA address (HIP initiated linking)
If linking token has expired, a new link token is obtained via demo auth &amp;amp; health record must be linked.
Here&amp;rsquo;s more to understand on HIP initiated linking:
Whenever a new health record is created for a patient, decide which care context this will be a part of.</description></item><item><title>Notification to Mobile</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/link-care-context/notification-mobile/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 04:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/link-care-context/notification-mobile/index.html</guid><description>Notification to Mobile Applicable when: User has come to the hospital, does not share ABHA address during registration but shares mobile, name, age, gender.

Upon receipt of the request, the HIP health repository reverts with a set of care context labels (in masked form).
The following flow diagram details the flows that take place during patient information discovery from the HIP perspective:</description></item></channel></rss>
