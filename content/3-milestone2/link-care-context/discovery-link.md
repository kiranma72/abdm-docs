## Discovery and Linking of patient records

- ABDM allows a user to find their health records from any health facility they have visited via the discovery process. 
- Users can use an PHR app to select the health facility they visited and initiate a "Discovery" request 
- The HIE-CM forwards the discovery request to the the HRP linked to the health facility
- All HRPs / HIPs must correctly implement the discovery API
- The HRP is expected to return all the care contexts for the user if records are found 
- The user can then link them to their ABHA address. 

### Sample User Experience

{{< gallery dir="3-milestone2/link-care-context/user-experience" />}} {{< load-photoswipe >}}

### Implementing the discovery algorithm

1. When a discovery request is initiated by the user, the HIP will receive a list of verified identifiers along with name and demographic information. Verified information includes the ABHA address, the mobile number name, gender, year of birth. Unverified / user declared information can include a medical registration number issued by the health facility and shared by the user.

2. The HRP must search for records that match this patient by implementing the matching logic depicted in the flowchart below

id1 -->|Yes| id5((Return<br/>matching Records))

id6 --> |No| id4
id6 --> |Yes| id7{Is the name phonetically similar?}
id7 --> |No| id4
id7 --> |Yes| id8((Return<br/>matching Records))

3. As response to the discovery request, the HRP/HIP must organize the patient data into [care contexts](/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/understand-care-context/) and respond with a list of care contexts found. Ensure no clinical information is shared in the response.

## API Information Request Response 

#### DISCOVERY

**1. Discover patient's accounts**

Request for patient care context discover, made by Gateway intended for a specific HIP.

**BASE URL:** Callback URL registered by HRP

{{< swaggermin src="/abdm-docs/Yaml/ndhm-hip.yml" api="POST /v0.5/care-contexts/discover$" >}}

**2. Response To Patient's Account Discovery Request**

**BASE URL:** https://dev.abdm.gov.in/gateway

{{< swaggermin src="/abdm-docs/Yaml/ndhm-hip.yml" api="POST /v0.5/care-contexts/on-discover$" >}}

# Linking of discovered care contexts

![Link Record Step 3](/abdm-docs/img/linkrecord-Step3.png)

- This flow begins once a user initiates a link request after discovering care contexts.  
- The User shares the reference number and care contexts to be linked via the PHR app
- On getting the link/init request, the HRP/HIP must send an OTP to the patientâ€™s phone number
- The HIP/HRP then responds with link/on-init to HIE-CM
- The user enters the OTP in the PHR App and the app triggers the link/confirm
- The HIP/HRP verifes the otp and sends the link/on-confirm. 
- On getting the on-confirm, the HIE-CM links the care contexts to the ABHA address
