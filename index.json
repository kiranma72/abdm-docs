This enables the user/patients to complete the seamless profile share during their visit.\nSteps to scanning the QR Code:\nPatient must have an ABHA app and have a valid ABHA address Hospital must generate a Health Facility QR code and display it at the registration counter Patient can then scan the QR code from his phone camera or his ABHA application If scanned from phone camera – The list of installed PHR apps is shown on the phone. The user can select any of the applications. If scanned from within the PHR app, the app will call the share-profile API to the Health Facility. The Health Facility will verify this is a registered healthcare provider and identify the HRP linked to this Health Facility in the ABDM registry. The Gateway will call the share-profile API on the callback URL registered for this Health Facility The HRP software must create a screen to display all the scanned profiles for a (counter) code The operator (at the counter) should be able to select a shared profile and perform a fast user registration.

This field is passed back to the facility as part of the share-profile API call and can be used to identify the physical location where the QR code is present. Given that the patient profile will be shared among all the counters and dynamic logic would be used for mapping the QR code to the counter,the counter number should be optional in payload for both QR code generation and scanning URL: This URL is static and this needs to be dynamic This URL needs to change to some generic URL aligned with QR code action which is easily understood by user. Other points: While scanning the QR code from an android device, the experience may differ based on android version, brand of the mobile and skin of the android OS. Tech team to also provide list of exceptions, if any along with the list of devices/operating system on which this experience will not work or will have limited experience. The experience may also differ based on the QR scanning application from which the user is scanning the QR code.

Read this to understand how various building blocks of ABDM works and where your application fits in this ecosystem.\nElectronic Health Records Health Facility Registry (HFR) for facility identity What is a Health Information Provider (HIP)? What is a Health repository Provider (HRP)? Identifying patients via ABHA address Use ABHA number for patients without phones Health Information Exchange \u0026 Consent Manager Capturing ABHA address during patient registration Linking of records by HRP / HIP Discovery of records by patients Federated Health Records Architecture PHR applications \u0026 Health Lockers What are Health Information Users (HIUs) Sharing Health records with consent HIP / HIU Guidelines HDCM Policy ABDM uses a federated health record (FHR) framework that allows users (patients) to collect their health records across various healthcare providers, view their records from any Personal Health Record (PHR) application and share their records with their consent\nThe image below shows the various entities/roles involved in the FHR framework\nElectronic Health Records Electronic Health records are digital records that are created by Health service providers as part of their interactions with patients. Health Providers use specialized software called electroic medical record (EMR), health information management systems (HIMS) or Lab information management systems (LIMS) to create these health records.\nHealth records include Diagnostic reports, discharge summaries, prescriptions, OP consultation notes, etc. The ABDM FHR framework deals with the format of health records (to enable interoperability), the storage of health records (to ensure they are available) and the sharing of health records with consent. Every Health record contains information about who is the patient, which health professional provided the treatment and at which facility. ABDM requires each of these entities to obtain a digital identifier and use that identifer when creating / linking health records under ABDM.\nHealth Facility Registry (HFR) for facility identity Health Facilities are issued a HFR ID when their register their facility with ABDM. They can register via https://facility.abdm.gov.in. Digital Solution Companies can also help their customers register with HFR within their software by integrating with the HFR APIs.\nWhat is a Health Information Provider (HIP)? Any entity that agrees to share digital health records with their users using the ABDM APIs is called an HIP (Health Information Provider). HIPs can be hospitals, labs, health care centers, government health programs, teleconsultation players, clinics or pharmacies - basically any entity which creates medical data pertaining to a patient. The HFR ID is used to identify which facility has agreed to become a HIP and is sharing health information. (HFR ID == HIP ID)\nHIPs are required to maintain a digital copy of both the inpatient and outpatient records for each person in their care. They also need to adhere to the HIP HIU Guidelines\nHIPs are eligible for financial incentives under the ABDM Digital Health Incentive Scheme\nWhat is a Health Repository Provider (HRP)? Health repository providers are digital solution companies who offer ABDM compliant software to health facilities like hospitals, diagnostic centers etc. An instance of an ABDM certified software is a HRP. The HRP enables healthcare providers to become HIPs or HIUs and meet their obligations of sharing and securely maintaining health records of patients digitally. HRPs offer long term storage of health records on behalf of a HIP. For example, a hosted lab information management system provider (LIMS) may update their software to become a ABDM compatible Health Repository Provider. Any lab using this hosted LIMS software can rapidly become a HIP by adopting the software.\nThe ABDM sandbox hosts a reference HRP – You can play with it at https://emrsbx.abdm.gov.in\nIdentifying patients via ABHA address In order to manage their personal health records, users (patients) must first create an account on a HIE-CM – called their Ayushman Bharath Health Account (ABHA) address. This looks like sandeep321@abdm. The @abdm tells us which HIE-CM is responsibile for this address.\nThe term ABHA address is also reffered to as PHR address across the documentation\nHospitals \u0026 Labs are expected to link records with their patients ABHA Address. Creating an ABHA Address is super simple – You can start with just Name, Year of birth, Gender along with a Mobile number. ABHA address can be linked to a strongly validated \u0026 unique ABHA Number\nABDM is designed to work for people with smartphones, features phones and even those without phones. Users with smartphones can be encourgaed to get their ABHA address via a PHR app. They can create a easy to remember ABHA address that is alphanumeric like sandeep321@abdm. Users with only feature phones or without phones will require assitance in creating an ABHA address. It is recommended that they create an ABHA number (preferably with Aadhaar). Every ABHA number also automatically acts as a ABHA address on the NHA HIE-CM and looks like \u003c14digitabha\u003e@abdm\nUsers can create an ABHA address by downloading a PHR mobile application or on a portal provided by the HIE-CM. Use phr.abdm.gov.in to create a new ABHA address\nUsers can create an ABHA addresses in one of two ways:\nUsing self declared information - This requires Name, Year of Birth gender along with a mobile number or email Using an ABHA Number - This requires users to first create an ABHA number with strong KYC Users can start with a self declared ABHA address and later link it to an ABHA number\nNote : While users are allowed to create more than one ABHA address, ABDM encourages every user to have only ONE ABHA address. The process of obtaining an ABHA address is designed to ensure that users don’t accidentally create multiple addresses\nTry it out - Create an ABHA address that you can use on the ABDM sandbox at phrsbx.abdm.gov.in. This will create an ABHA address on the @sbx HIE-CM hosted within the sandbox\nUse ABHA number for patients without phones ABHA number is a 14 digit number that is unique (only one per person) issued only after a strong KYC. Every ABHA number is automatically available as an ABHA address on the NHA HIE-CM like \u003c14digitabhano\u003e@abdm. ABHA is a core building block of the ABDM ecosystem and integrates with several other systems to provide online KYC including Aadhaar, Driving licence and PAN\nYou can obtain an ABHA number by signing up at https://abha.abdm.gov.in\nABHA numbers are extremely important for helping those who use feature phones or do not use a phone to manage their personal health records. ABHA numbers are issued in assisted mode extensively by all Government health programs. Government programs are encouraged to link any health records they create to \u003c14digitabhano\u003e@abdm.\nYou can play around with the sandbox instance of the ABHA building block at https://abhasbx.abdm.gov.in\nHealth Information Exchange \u0026 Consent Manager (HIE-CM) This is the key ABDM building block that manages ABHA addresses, maintains links to health data for each ABHA address and manages consents provided by the user for sharing of their health data. It also supports exchange of interoperable health data between HIPs and HIUs.\nThe ABDM architecture is designed to support multiple HIE-CMs to operate in the network. Each HIE-CM is referred to by a domain. NHA operates 2 HIE-CMs currently. A Sandbox HIE-CM with the domain @sbx and a production HIE-CM with the domain @abdm.\nThe diagram below shows how the HIE-CM orchestrates the linking of health records in ABDM.\nCapturing ABHA address during patient registration Health Facilities are required to modify their processes during patient registration to include the capture of ABHA address from patients. This is the primary area where a change management is required. All the other ABDM FHR related processes are in the background and do not require significant operational changes by the health facility.\nABHA address can be captured by the facility by any of the following methods\nScanning Health Facility QR code - Every health facility can create a QR code that can be displayed at their registration counter. Patients can scan this QR code from any PHR application. This “scan and share” action ensures that patient demograhics (including the ABHA address) is instantly shared from the PHR app to the ABDM compliant EMR / HIMS software being used by the health facility\nScanning the QR on the users ABHA card - Users without phones / feature phones can be issued a ABHA no and a printed ABHA card. This contains a QR code that can be rapidly scanned by the health facility using a 2D barcode scanner. It provides all the demographic information about the patient and also the ABHA address of the user\nVerbally shared ABHA address - Users may share their ABHA address verbally during registration. Health facilities can verify the ABHA address and obtain the demographic details associated with the address by initiating an authentication request. This will result in an OTP being sent to the user which they can then share with the health facility\nLinking of records by Health facility If the patient has shared their ABHA address with the health facility, then the facility must link any new health record it creates to the ABHA address. Linking is done by adding a “Care Context” to the ABHA address. The care context only contains - a reference id to the actual health record and a display text that can be shown to the user. The display text should not contain any health information either. The FHR architecture is designed to ensure that the HIE-CM is “data blind”, ie does not have access to any health data of the patient.\nWhenever a new care context is linked to a ABHA address, the HIE-CM notifies all PHR apps being used by the patient that a new care context has been linked (or updated). The PHR app will request for a copy of the health record from the HRP and display it to the user.\nDiscovery \u0026 linking of records by patients Several patients may not have a ABHA address or share their ABHA address with the health facility at the time of registration. In such cases, the health facility will send an SMS the patient (via HIE-CM) that a new health record is available and can be accessed via any PHR app.\nAll PHR apps provide a “discovery” feature, where the user can search for a health facility and request for their health records. Users provide their name, year of birth, gender and mobile number as the parameters for this search. If there are records available at the health facility for this patient, the HRP will return a set of care contexts. All reocrds for the patient including historical records are expected to be provided via this method. The user can then link these discovered care contexts with their ABHA address using their PHR app.\nFederated Health Records Architecture ABDM is implemented as a Federated Architecture, where data is kept by the entity that generates the health data (HRP). The ABHA address only holds a set of care contexts which points to the health data across multiple HRPs. The HIE-CM is designed to be data blind, ie it does not know any details of the health records that are linked with the ABHA address.\nThe HIE-CM is also responsible for storing all consents provided by the user. ABDM uses a structured digital consent artifact that is based on the MietY consent framework. Each consent has a clear purpose of use, what type of records and from what period are being shared and how long the reciving entity (HIU) can keep / access these records. ABDM puts the user in control allowing them to easily grant, deny and revoke consents from their PHR app.\nThe HIE also allows health data to flow from HRPs to HIUs (with appropriate Consents). The health data is encrypted by the HRP so that only the requesting HIU entity can decrypt it. Also the design ensures the flow of data does not pass through the HIE-CM.\nUser generated health records like smart watches, home health monitors or even photos of health records can be linked to the ABHA address by PHR apps.\nThe FHR architecture is aligned with the upcoming Data Protection Bill. Any health facility using a ABDM compliant software would be able compliant to the provisions of the Data protection bill.\nSummary of the FHR Architecture\nNo central data repository Your ABHA Address only holds links to your health records Your Health record is held by Health Facility that generated the record You can get a copy of the record and save it long term using a PHR application You are in control of your health data and can decide what and whom you share it Even after your share, you can change your mind and revoke your consent at any time. You can also upload any health records by scanning them or even add data from your wearable devices to your health record via PHR apps Only verified health facilities that are part of the Health Facility Registry can link health records with your ABHA address PHR applications \u0026 Health Lockers Personal Health Record Applications are software service providers who offer web / mobile applications to individuals. ABDM is designed to have multiple PHR offerings as choice to user. Every PHR apps can\nHelp users create an ABHA address Discover and link health records Help user grant / revoke consents Allow users to view their records Offer long term storage of records, Support uploading of users health records Share records on the ABDM network. NHA has created the ABHA PHR application as a reference application. The Aarogasetu App has also been upgraded to become an ABDM compliant PHR App.\nABDM also rolled out a specification for a “Health Locker”. Lockers are entities that offer long term storage of health records to users. This functionality has been included in the requirements of a PHR application\nYou can play around with the sandbox instance of the ABHA PHR app at https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in\nWhat is an HIU? An HIU (Health Information User) is an entity that wants access to the digital health information linked to a ABHA address. An HIU can be a hospital, clinic, PHR app, healthcare technology company, organizations working on health analytics, insurers, medical researchers, government entities etc. HIUs first need to collect a consent from the user and then can request for health records. HIUs get a copy of the patients records and use them only for the purpose specified in the consent and must delete them if the consent expires or is revoked by the user.\nSharing Health Records With Consent When any HIU wants to access records linked with a PHR address, it initiates a consent request with the HIE-CM The consent request consists of the purpose for which health records are being sought, why type of records are being sought, from what time period and how long will the HIU like to retain these records HIE-CM forwards the request to the user who can view the request on their PHR app and decide what he actually wants to share when he grants the consent User’s can also decide to revoke the consent anytime after it is granted If the user grants the consent, the HIE-CM shares a signed consent artificat with the the requesting HIU The HIU can now request for data for a ABHA address along with the signed consent artificat The HIE-CM forwards the request to all HRPs that are holding the linked data The HRPs verify the consent and push the data to the HIU Data has to be in the specified FHIR format to achieve interoperability Data is encrypted using a method that ensures only the requesting HIU can decrypt the data Health Data Management Policy \u0026 HIP / HIU Guidelines Any entity participating in ABDM will need to adhere to the Health Data Management Policy and the HIP/HIU Guidelines\nThis policy is a guidance document to set out the minimum standard for data privacy protection that should be followed by all the participants/stakeholders of the ABDM ecosystem. It is a first step in realizing ABDM’s guiding principle of “Security \u0026 Privacy by Design” for the protection of individual’s personal digital health data.\nThe Guidelines cover the responsibilities of Health Information Providers, Health Repository Providers, Health Information Users and Personal Health Records Apps\nDigital Solution Companies must familizarize themselves with the Policy \u0026 Guidelines and ensure they support health facilities, consumers and health data users to comply with the same.\nThe ABDM Gateway Gateway is the hub that mediates and connects HIE-CMs, Health Repository Providers and HIUs in the network. Its primary job is to allow for discovery, routing in the network. The gateway does the following:\nConnects and validates the HIE-CMs and health repositories (servicing HIUs and HIPs) to the network. Enables routing of information. Authenticates connected systems within the PHR network (provides a signed authentication token for further communication). The entire PHR framework including the gateway communicates via asynchronous APIs over HTTPs channel. The following figure provides a view of how the Gateway fits in with other components Experience PHR in action using the ABDM sandbox ABDM provides a sandbox environment with core essential services that enable integrators who want to become HIPs/HIUs/HRPs or PHR apps build and test their integration.\nTry out the following\nCreate a PHR address on the sandbox from https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in/ Use EMRSBX to register your PHR address and link it with a new health record Download and login to the Sandbox PHR app with your new PHR address Download ABHA App Provide consent and view the health record you linked via EMRSBX Try adding your COVID vaccination record from CoWIN to your PHR address Other relevant documents National Digital Health Blueprint National Health Stack Electronic Consent Framework ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"The FHR Framework","uri":"/abdm-docs/1-basics/the_phr_framework/index.html"},{"content":"What is UHI? The Unified Health Interface (UHI) is a network where applications built on the UHI open protocol can interoperably connect with each other to provide health services. UHI is a key Digital Public Infrastructure that enables discoverability and transaction for digital health services. UHI works with other ABDM building blocks like HIE-CM for interoperable exchange of personal health data and registries like HPR \u0026 HFR to enable trust from participating doctors and health facilities. UHI takes an ‘Open Network’ approach to build the gateway and to enable the creation of a nationwide, decentralized, open, and inclusive network.\nABDM manages the UHI Gateway and the UHI Registry. Any application that wishes to participate in UHI must\nImplement the UHI protocol Register with the UHI registry Use the UHI Gateway to discover other UHI apps \u0026 their services Comply with the UHI Market Rules Share metrics with UHI for reporting, greviance redressal and dispute resolution It will be provide a system to facilitate the discovery of services between user facing applications and health service provider applications. Open access across diverse health service providers and patients can drastically expand demand-supply ecosystems and transform the digital healthcare landscape in India.\nWhat is UHI Open Protocol? UHI Open Protocol is a Decentralized Health Protocols aimed to define the interoperable protocol specifications for creating a decentralized network of health services. The purpose of APIs is to enable interoperability between Healthcare providers (doctors, paramedical, health facilities, etc.) and Healthcare consumers. The UHI Open Protocol architecture and APIs allow individuals/ organizations to set up an open network of consumer side applications and health service provider side platforms using common protocol specifications. It renders open APIs, schemas and example flows for the different use cases in healthcare.\nThe protocol is being developed as an open community initiative on GitHub https://github.com/dhp-project/DHP-Specs\nUHI Services The services on UHI will include, but not be limited to\nTeleconsultation Booking Physical Appointments Lab Bookings Ambulance Services Blood Donation UHI Participants Any service transaction in UHI involves five entities:\nUser: Patients seeking digital health services through UHI.\nEnd User Application (EUA): User-facing applications offering digital health services\nUHI Gateway: Layer routing the initial requests and responses involved in UHI transactions between HSPAs and EUAs\nHealth Service Provider Application (HSPA): Provider-facing applications allowing doctors to respond to EUA requests and fulfill digital health services\nHealth Service Provider (HSP): Providers of healthcare services\nRole of the UHI Gateway The role of the gateway in a UHI service transaction is limited to the search and discoverability of health services. For example, if a user searches for teleconsultation services on an EUA, the gateway routes the request to all available HSPAs and sends back the responses to the EUA. The booking, payment and fulfillment of the service, thereafter, is done directly between the EUA and the HSPA.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"UHI Protocol","uri":"/abdm-docs/6-uhi/about_uhi/index.html"},{"content":"Creation of ABHA Number ABHA number is a 14 digit number that is unique (only one per person) issued only after a strong KYC.

Each HMIS/LMIS system must decide how they want to organise data in care context.\nOur recommendations:\nOne care context for every outpatient visit \u0026 1 care context for inpatient visit. Every care context has a reference ID, and a display name. The reference ID is internal to the hmis/lmis system \u0026 must be used to identify the set of health records associated with the care context. The display name can contain info that helps the user identify which records are included but must not contain any confidential information or test results.

The information provided in the above section is meant only for guidance. Usually in EMR/EHR/PMS systems at hospitals, the systems index and patient records are filtered by patient-id and potentially grouped by any of the above means.\nIn terms of hierarchy, consider the following to understand how patients’ records may be grouped in HIP systems:\nEncounter or visit: This records the details of activity (one or more) directly relating to the patient. It is not advised to send specific clinical-encounters (single clinical-patient interaction) as care-context, unless you are sure that such recordings are going to be very limited. Episode of care: This grouping means can link a series of encounters together in case of problems. Program: This grouping can link a series of care episodes or visits. For example: IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness) as seen in various MCTS programs in Indian context Vertical program specific like India’s TB elimination program - Nikshay National Noncommunicable diseases (NCD) program National Health Mission (NHM) Specific program targeted for Health and Wellness Centers It is quite possible that a HIP system may not be capable of doing such grouping. In such cases only, consider using the same care-context reference that’s assigned to patient reference in the HIP system.\nThe idea is to provide an aggregate or grouped means of patient’s care settings at various healthcare centers. If proper care context grouping is not provided, patients who visit healthcare centers for different treatments will be forced to discover and link their care settings for each therapy or service.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Understand Care Context","uri":"/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/understand-care-context/index.html"},{"content":"By Demographics Applicable To HMIS / LMIS (PVT) Government Health App Scan User ABHA QR/Demographics Mandatory Mandatory Functionality Overview ABDM requires HMIS/LMIS to generate a link token that can be used for linking of health records.

For this to happen, we expect organizations that build software for hospitals, labs, insurers, consumers to implement certain functionalities by integrating with ABDM building blocks. The ABDM sandbox provides tools and support to test the integration. Once integrated, the software developers (companies) can get independent functional validation and apply for ABDM certification (by applying for Sandbox Exit). The certified version of the software can then be deployed for the various health service providers.\nHere’s how your journey through the sandbox looks like:\nRegister for access to the Sandbox Receive a Sandbox client ID \u0026 secret (key) from National Health Authority (NHA) Understand the various functionalities (test cases) to be implemented for each integration milestone Get comfortable with the APIs for each functionality using Postman Implement the functionality in your application Get functional validation report from one of the 3 empanelled companies Get security test report from any CERT-in empanelled organization Apply for Sandbox Exit Demo your app to NHA team Obtain a Production client ID \u0026 secret (key) from NHA Deploy your ABDM certified application with your customers ABDM Integration Milestones The integration steps have been broken into milestones to make it easier for integrators. Each Milestone has a set of functional test cases that must be supported by your application as part of certification\nMilestone 1: ABHA Number creation and capture \u0026 verification for seamless patient registration. Milestone 2: Building Health Information Provider (HIP) services to share digital records via any Personal Health Records (PHR) app. Milestone 3: Developing Health Information User (HIU) services to provide view of patient’s medical history to authorized healthcare workers with complete consent PHR \u0026 Locker Apps: Subscriptions for notifications, helping users manage consents, upload of user scanned records and more Before you start integration Check which milestones are applicable for your type of application here Understand the concepts \u0026 functionality required for each milestone Review the test cases for each milestone Download the Postman collection and validate each API that is part of a test case in the sandbox Integrate the APIs with your application once you are confident on how it works using Postman ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About ABDM Sandbox","uri":"/abdm-docs/1-basics/about_abdm_sandbox/index.html"},{"content":"Deactivate ABHA via Mobile Otp Overview of the functionality Users may De-activate his/her ABHA (Health ID) Following will happen (during the deactivation period) if you deactivate your ABHA (Health ID) :\nYou will lose access to all ABDM applications.

There are 3 major steps that a doctor needs to complete before providing any service through UHI\nSet up Calendar/availability The doctor can chose to set their available timings on set days. There are two options that can be made available to the doctor\nFixed - The time interval is fixed. Flexi - The doctor provides the number of patients they wish to allocate in a hour. Each patient gets a token. Provide their fees/charges: The doctor can chose to charge different fees for different services they wish to provide.\nUI Reference API Sequence A teleconsultation starts with a /search which is broadcasted to all the registered HSPAs through the gateway. The next set of API calls happen directly with the HSPA and EUA. These include /init and /confirm APIs to which the HSPA responds via /on_init and /on_confirm.\nResponding to a search request Example JSONs The following JSONs represent the Search API that are fired from the EUA for each of the above criteria. If the user provides multiple criteria, the resultant JSON will be a consolidation of the individual parameters used. The search query is broadcast to all relevant HSPAs by the Gateway and the corresponding on_search callback responses are sent back to the EUA from the Gateway. The on_search response from the HSPA will contain the catalog of doctors who meet the search criteria.

Teleconsultation","uri":"/abdm-docs/6-uhi/building-uhi-hspa/setup-for-teleconsultation/index.html"},{"content":"UHI Architecture UHI aims to transform the way digital health services are rendered in India, while ensuring that it is in sync with the other building blocks of ABDM. The functional architecture for UHI is mentioned below. The aim of this architecture is to ensure interoperability for health services and health data. The architecture also depicts how UHI will interact with the other building blocks within ABDM.\nArchitecture Steps 1.A Patient Sign Up/ Login: Patients login using their ABHA number/ Aadhar number / Mobile Number. This is verified by HIE-CM (for login via ABHA number) and UIDAI (for login via Aadhar) through an OTP authentication, post which the login is enabled. In case patients do not have an account, they are asked to sign up using their Aadhar or by providing any other identification documents.\n1.B Health Service Provider Sign Up/ Login: Health Service Providers (HSPs) login using their HPID/ HPR Address (Health Professional Address) on thw HSPA. In case the HSP does not have a Health Professional Address, he/she will be asked to create one using their Registration Number registered with their respective State Council.\n1.C Health Service Provider Details sent to HPR: The details filled by the the Health Service Provider are sent back to the Health Professional Registry.\n2. Patient Search for a Doctor: A patient searches for a doctor on the EUA via defined parameters. The EUA fires Search API to the UHI Gateway to look for the doctors matching the search criteria across the network.\n3. Search Request Sent to all Registered HSPAs: The UHI Gateway broadcasts the search request and the search parameters to all the HSPAs registered on UHI.\n4.A Matching HSPAs Respond: All HSPAs that match the criteria sent by the gateway respond to the request via on_search. HSPAs send back x, y and z. The gateway forwards all responses back to the EUA.\n4.B HSPAs Directly Send Availability to EUAs: While x, y and z is sent via the gateway, as mentioned in the step above, the HSPAs send the availability of a chosen HSP directly to the EUA. This is done via on_search API.\n5. Patient Initiates Booking: The patient choosen any available slot and initiates booking on the EUA. The EUA calls innit API through which it sends the order details.\n6. HSPA Responds to Booking: The HSPA responds via on_innit API and also sends the payment terms for the transaction.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"UHI Architecture Overview","uri":"/abdm-docs/6-uhi/uhi_architecture_overview/index.html"},{"content":"Deactivate ABHA This scenario covers\nThrough Aadhaar OTP Through Mobile OTP ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Deactivate ABHA","uri":"/abdm-docs/7-abha-number/deactivate-abha/index.html"},{"content":"Verify ABHA Address What is ABHA Address?\nABHA Address is an easy to remember username that enables a user to access their health records digitally and share their records with various healthcare providers.\nAn ABHA address may look like ‘name@abdm’.

The matching logic is as depicted in the flowchart below and also in API specifications: Note: Look for APIs with tag discovery and link %%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% flowchart LR id1 --\u003e|Yes| id5((Return\u003cbr/\u003ematching Records)) id1{Do I have any records for ABHA Address?} --\u003e|No| id2{Do I have any records for Mobile Phone?} id2 --\u003e |No| id9{Do I have records for \u003cbr/\u003eMedical Record Registration number?} id9 --\u003e |Yes|id3 id9 --\u003e |No|id4((No\u003cbr/\u003ematching records\u003cbr/\u003efound)) id2 --\u003e|Yes| id3{Does the gender match?} id3 --\u003e |No| id4 id3 --\u003e|Yes| id6{Is the age within +/- 5 years?} id6 --\u003e |No| id4 id6 --\u003e |Yes| id7{Is the name phonetically similar?} id7 --\u003e |No| id4 id7 --\u003e |Yes| id8((Return\u003cbr/\u003ematching Records)) As response to the discovery request, the HIP must send several masked details, as follows: Patient reference: MHCXX111 - typically the identifier for the patient at the HIP. Display: A description of the patient, comprising of the following information: Name: John Doe Email id: johndoe@example.com Minor: Mother’s name is Jane Doe Refrain from providing any critical information in the display area. For the patient, you need to send one or more care-context detail, as follows: Care context reference: ABXXX222 Display: General diagnosis Provide only a general hint of the patient’s care context here, staying away from private diagnostic details. Here’s an example: TB program: Use your Nikshay program ID PMJAY program: This context is linked with your PMJAY ID - PXXX239 Your last visit was with Dr. Shekhar on 21/03/2020 This is a child’s immunization program Hospitals group patient data in the form of care context. Think of care-context as information about an association of a patient with an HIP for a period of time under which related healthcare activities may occur. Grouping of the care context can be based on the following: Program-based: A patient visiting a hospital can sign up for any program, and belong to multiple programs as well. This kind of grouping is done generally in hospitals which deal with care programs for multiple ailments and specialities such as the general checkup service, cancer program, maternity care and so on. Visit-based: Patient record can be tagged as inpatient, outpatient, or emergency, based on the purpose of the patient’s visit. Episode of Care: Some hospitals are capable of grouping patient records by the specific episode of care Department-based: Patient records can be tagged by department as well, especially in large general hospitals. Verify the patient and link the carecontext as requested by the patient This flow begins once a patient initiates a link request to the HIP to link the care context to the patient’s Consent Manager’s User ID.\nTo enable the linking, the HIP system returns a link reference number along with the authentication type and its associated parameters.\nThe HIP system sends an OTP to the patient’s phone number. Note, the phone number for OTP communication from HIP may be the same as verified by the CM or maybe a different number that the patient has chosen as preferred mode of communication with HIP - meaning it’s up to the HIP to choose the phone number it sends OTP to.\nThe patient, via patient app, submits the OTP received from the HIP system within the stipulated time. If the patient is successfully authenticated by the HIP, the linking is now complete.\nThe following flow diagrams details the flows that take place while linking to a health repository representing an HIP:\n%%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% sequenceDiagram title Linking (HIP side) PHR App-\u003e\u003eGateway:Link Care Context Gateway-\u003e\u003eRepository:POST/v0.5/links/link/init activate Repository Repository--\u003e\u003eHIP System:Link init Request HIP System--\u003e\u003eRepository: Response Repository-\u003e\u003eGateway:POST/v0.5/links/link/on-init HIP System--\u003e\u003eUser: Send token out-of-band Gateway-\u003e\u003eRepository: POST/v0.5/links/link/confirm Repository--\u003e\u003eHIP System:Link Confirm Request HIP System--\u003e\u003eRepository: Response Repository-\u003e\u003eGateway:POST/v0.5/links/link/on-confirm deactivate Repository API Information Request Response DISCOVERY 1.

Supposed to be used for/by health workers (like Asha, A\u0026M) in their public applications.\nHealth worker is expected to capture the Aadhaar number, name, year of birth and gender of the patient (user) as in Aadhaar card. These details can be physically captured on paper or in mobile application which works in offline mode as well. Consent of the user must always be obtained (in paper or offline apps) in the recommended language. When connectivity is available, the application calls the ABHA demographic API with the same (Aadhaar number, name, year of birth and gender) information. The ABHA system checks with UIDAI if the information provided is correct. The ABHA system also checks if an ABHA number has already been created in the past. Then the system returns the ABHA number (already created or generates new). When calling this API, care must be taken to ensure:\nThe correct state and district of the beneficiary are passed. The mobile number that is passed is assumed to be verified by the government application and is not re-verified by ABHA.

setting up a teleconsultation service except the doctor doesn’t need to provide their signature for signing the prescriptions.\nSet up Calendar/availability The doctor can chose to set their available timings on set days. There are two options that can be made available to the doctor\nFixed - The time interval is fixed. Flexi - The doctor provides the number of patients they wish to allocate in a hour. Each patient gets a token. Provide their fees/charges: The doctor can chose to charge different fees for different services they wish to provide.\nProvide bank details/UPI address to receive payments\nUI Reference API Sequence A physical consultation starts with a /search which is broadcasted to all the registered HSPAs through the gateway. The next set of API calls happen directly with the HSPA and EUA. These include /init and /confirm APIs to which the HSPA responds via /on_init and /on_confirm.\nResponding to a search request Example JSONs The following JSONs represent the Search API that are fired from the EUA for each of the above criteria. If the user provides multiple criteria, the resultant JSON will be a consolidation of the individual parameters used. The search query is broadcast to all relevant HSPAs by the Gateway and the corresponding on_search callback responses are sent back to the EUA from the Gateway. The on_search response from the HSPA will contain the catalog of doctors who meet the search criteria.

The HIU sends these values to HDCM, along with the data request via a digitally-signed API call. HDCM forwards the request to the HIP, again via a digitally-signed API call. HIP checks whether the consent artefact is valid, and whether the data being requested is in keeping with the terms of the artefact. If the artefact is valid, the HIP does the following: Generates a fresh ECDH public-private key pair in the same group as specified by the HIU ((dhsk(P), dhpk(P)) Generates a 32-byte random value rand(P) aka nonce. Computes a ECDH shared key dhk(U,P) using dhpk(U) and dhsk(P) Computes a 256-bit session key sk(U,P) using dhpk(U) and dhsk(P), which is used to encrypt the data sent from HIP to HIU. HIP sends the public key dhpk(P), the nonce rand(P) and the encrypted data to the HIU. Data decryption for HIU The following process is applied to decrypt the data that the HIU receives:\nHIU receives the encrypted data along with keymaterial containing dhpk(p), nonce. HIU queries through stored data and gets the keymaterial which it created when initiating the data flow request, as follows: It computes a ECDH shared key dhk(U,P) using dhpk(P) and dhsk(U). It then computes a 256-bit session key sk(U,P) using dhpk(P) and dhsk(U), which is used to decrypt the data sent from HIP to HIU. Note: In order to generate the shared secret key, dhpk(P) should be used, minus headers. Following the big endian (network byte order) keeps the used to derive the shared secret consistent. Also as the cryptography deals with large numbers, it’s recommended that no data is converted to binary format until its first converted to big integer.\nHere is a sample set of libraries that you can use:\nOpenssl Bouncy castle (ensure the X dhpk is a big integer) NaCl Libgcrypt PyNaCls TweetNaCl While most libraries allow exporting of public keys, these keys are compressed and encoded for the most part. It is best to use the libraries to extract the uncompressed form of the public key, that will start with a hex 04. The 32 bytes after the 04 is the X.\nThe ECDH mechanism ensures that the shared key dh(U,P) can also be computed at the other end by the HIU using the values dhpk(P) (HIP’s ECDH public key) and dhsk(U) (HIU’s ECDH private key). For this reason, the HIP must ensure that the encrypted data is sent along with dhpk(P) and rand(P).\nThe following data flow diagram represents the information encryption and decryption process between the HIU and the HIP:\nSteps to encrypt data The following steps are involved in data encryption, on both sides:\nThe session key is derived from the shared secret key dh(U, P) as follows:\nXOR the nonce (HIP and HIU) Take the first 20 bytes as the salt for HKDF Derive the key using HKDF(shared key, salt) Now encrypt the data using AES GCM as follows:\nXOR the nonce Take the last 12 bytes as the IV for GCM Encrypt the data Data encryption summary: Choice of Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman parameters\nThe key exchange will be performed over Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) groups. We will adhere to a single ECC curve, namely Curve25519, in all encryption operations. Curve25519 is used in ECDH implementations in various protocols like SSH and WhatsApp.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"New Prog.

The HIU must remove any copy of the users’ data when the consent is revoked.\nAll HIPs who are holding any data associated with this consent are notified. They must save a copy of the consent artefact in their system. Data can be shared against this consent any number of times till the consent expires / is revoked by the user. Making a consent request (as HIU) An HIU can create a request to obtain a patient’s consent to access her health information, as follows:\nAs an HIU, you will need to log in to sandbox’s reference doctor’s interface with login credentials (this will be sent to you via email). If you don’t have your login credentials, Send a Request to Integrate Your Test Environment to NHA. NHA will respond along with your login credentials. After logging in, you can create the consent request by providing the following details: User’s consent manager ID Purpose of your consent request Details of who is requesting the health information The time period for which you require the patient’s health documents. This information will enable your HIP to share the patient’s health documents relevant to the required time period. Provide a list of the health information types for which you’re requesting, such as clinical notes, examination data and so forth. Your consent request as HIU comes with a consent expiry time, after which you will not be able to access the patient’s data. Receiving a consent artefact (as HIP) The HIP receives the consent artefact after patients grants a request. The consent artefact lets the HIP know what data needs to be shared, as detailed below:\nPatient’s consent manager ID Purpose of data access consent Details of who is requesting the health information and of whom Health information types; the HIP needs to maintain details of what has been requested and what has been sent, as detailed in the following table: What is requested? What needs to be sent? Prescription Medicaton that the doctor advised Diagnostic Report Diagnostic Report that was created following a test/procedure OP Consultation Out Patient Consultation Document which may include complaints, prescription, observations, follow ups, appointments, test reports etc Discharge Summary Discharge Summary document which may include conditions, medications, observations, procedure done, discharge note, treatment plan etc Immunization Record Immunization records with any additional documents such as vaccine certificate, the next immunization recommendations, etc. Record artifact Unstructured historical health records as a single of multiple Health Record Documents generally uploaded by the patients through the Health Locker and can be shared across the health ecosystem. Wellness Record Regular wellness information of patients typically through the Patient Health Record (ABHA) application covering clinical information such as vitals, physical examination, general wellness, women wellness, etc. Note: For detailed information on what information can be sent for a requested HI Type, please refer to the Data Format Specifications\nThe consent request is time-bound; after time is elapsed the HIU cannot view the data once the user has granted and HIP should check this date before sending any data.

They do this by sending a consent request with the user’s ABHA address to the HIE-CM\nFrom an HIU perspective, the flow begins when the HIU (e.g. a Doctor at a Hospital) requests consent to view patient’s data.\nUpon receipt of such a request from Gateway, CM acknowledges and sends back a consent request ID to the HIU via the gateway.\nThe CM then notifies the patient that a HIU has made a consent request. The patient can view the request details, and choose to either grant consent or deny it.\nSubsequently, the CM notifies the HIU requester of the patient’s consent or denial status via the gateway.\nIf the request is granted, the CM sends across the Ids of the consent artefacts that were created against the request, to the HIU. If the request is denied, the CM simply notifies the HIU of the denial of the request. At the time when the patient registers with the hospital (for accessing medical history), this is (can be) initiated when the user scans the Heath facility QR code \u0026 registers Health Facility now has user’s ABHA address and can initiate a consent request.\nMeta Codes :\nWhile requesting and exchanging health information, there are meta codes that are relevant to you if you are a HIU.\nPurpose of Use - defines what is the purpose of use of the health information that a HIU is requesting for.

From the CM, the information is relayed to the HIP’s health repository (via the gateway).\nSecond Stage\nOnce the HIP repository receives the information, it first validates the information request, as follows:\nThe HIP finds out if the consent ID corresponds to an expired, paused or revoked artefact. It then checks if the request’s date-time range will correspond to the range for which the consent artefact allows information access. It also ensures that the encryption parameters are correctly defined. Once the above checks are made and validated, the HIP health repository encrypts the requested health records and forwards it along with the transaction ID to the HIU’s data push URL, after signing the encrypted data with its long-term private key. Third Stage\nFinally, the CM receives notifications from both the HIP and the HIU. The HIP’s health repository notifies the CM that the requested information was transmitted to the HIU. The HIU’s health repository sends a notification that the requested information was successfully received, or that the request failed.\nAll above 3 stages that pertains to HIP are shown in the following diagram:\n%%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", \"sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% sequenceDiagram title Request for Health Records HIE-CM-\u003e\u003eHIP/HRP:POST/v0.5/health-information/hip/request activate HIP/HRP HIP/HRP--\u003e\u003eHIP/HRP System:notification HIP/HRP-\u003e\u003eHIE-CM:POST/v0.5/health-information/hip/on-request When HIP gets the request for data transfer, it first validates the consent:\nConsent ID is valid Consent has not expired Data requested is within the consent granted range Only data types that are granted in the consent, are shared Test Cases Function Functionality Steps To Be Executed Data Transfer \u0026 Share Mandatory HIP must share health records associated with care context on request (HIP_INIT_SHARE_CARECONTEXT) 1.

Once the healthcare provider is selected, the PHR app triggers a discovery request with the HIE-CM. The discovery request includes the patient’s name, Year of Birth, Gender, ABHA Address \u0026 verified mobile number. The user can also add the patient registration number issued by the healthcare provider to make it easier to locate their health records. The HIE-CM forwards it to the selected healthcare provider (HIP). Currently the HIP is expected to respond to the discovery request within 10 seconds. If there are health records for this patient the list of care contexts is sent back by the HIP and PHR app presents this to the user. The user can now initiate linking of these care contexts with their ABHA address The HIP is expected to verify that the user credentials by sending an OTP to the user’s registered mobile number before allowing the linkage.

As part of the data request, the HIU’s health repository embeds three key elements within the health information request: The consent ID corresponding to the consent artefact against which the information request is being made. A data push URL, which is a callback URL that indicators where the information can be pushed by the HIP’s health repository. This URL can be different from the HIU’s access URL, provided at the time of registration with the gateway. The HIU can specify a different URL for the data flow, in order to keep its identity secret to the extent possible. Several parameters such as the date-time range for the requested and a set of encryption parameters for the HIP repository to encrypt the information. The Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman based encryption standard is used for encrypting health information. Upon receipt of the data-request, CM assigns a transaction ID (txn-id) for the entire data flow and communicates this Id to the health repositories of the HIU and the HIP. The HIU’s health repository relays all this information to the CM through the gateway. From the CM, the information is relayed to the HIP’s health repository (via the gateway).\nSecond Stage\nOnce the HIP repository receives the information, it first validates the information request, as follows:\nThe HIP finds out if the consent ID corresponds to an expired, paused or revoked artefact. It then checks if the request’s date-time range will correspond to the range for which the consent artefact allows information access. It also ensures that the encryption parameters are correctly defined. Once the above checks are made and validated, the HIP health repository encrypts the requested health records and forwards it along with the transaction ID to the HIU’s data push URL, after signing the encrypted data with its long-term private key. Third Stage\nFinally, the CM receives notifications from both the HIP and the HIU.

ABDM Client IDs \u0026 Call Back URLs Every organization that registers with ABDM is issued one or more Client IDs Each Client ID should be used by the organization to register ONE INSTANCE of their ABDM compiliant software One Client ID can be used to register only ONE callback URL. Each instance of the software can hold health records for one or more health facilities Each Health Facility is given an ID from the Health Facility Registry. The Facility ID \u0026 Client ID need to be registered in the ABDM Gateway registry This Facility id must be passed in X-HIP-ID Header in ABDM apis The HIE-CM APIs are designed to be asyncronous. When you call an API on the gateway, if the request is accepted you will merely get a HTTP 200 response acknowledging that the request has been recorded.\nOnce the response is available, the gateway will invoke the callback URL registered for the Client ID. All integrators must register a call back URL for their Client ID\nThe Sequence diagram below provides an example of the asyncronous nature of the ABDM APIs.\n%%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", \"sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% sequenceDiagram autonumber participant client as HRP participant gateway as ABDM Gateway Note over client : Each instance of HRP has a client Id from ABDM Note over client : Each instance registers a callback Url client-\u003e\u003egateway: /v0.5/users/auth/fetch-modes gateway-\u003e\u003eclient: Response: 200 (as acknowledgment) Note right of client : asynchronous calls gateway-\u003e\u003eclient: /v0.5/users/auth/on-fetch-modes client-\u003e\u003egateway: Response: 200 (as acknowledgment) s\nNote : Use ISO timestamps for current timestamps while working with apis in postman (For example: 2023-05-09T21:10:36.177Z)\nRegistering your callback URL The callback URL is the url for your site where your application recieves APIs calls from the ABDM gateway. After obtaining the client ID and the secret, use the gateway sessions api to get the accessToken. Use the below api, to register the callback url. Pass the Gateway Session Token in the “Authorization:” header and the callback url in “url:”.\ncurl --location --request PATCH 'https://dev.abdm.gov.in/devservice/v1/bridges' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Authorization: Bearer your-access-token-from-gateway-session' --data-raw '{ \"url\": \"https://my-emr-site.in\" } Disclaimer This API is only available in in sandbox. This is configured via a different API / UI in production\nAfter registering the callback url, if we fire any API which has a callback, ABDM will post the response of the fired API to that callback url. You can use the /v1/bridge/getServices API to check what is configured for your client ID including the callback URL.\nLinking the HIPs / HIUs ID for a Client ID The HIP code used by ABDM is the same as the health facility registry ID.\nIn the Sandbox you can simply declare a HIP/HIU ID without it being part of the health facility registry. You can use it to link one HIP / HIU ID with your Client ID with no validations.\nAll HIUs including PHR apps also need to register a HIU code.\nNote : Create unique (fake) HIP/HIU (both Id \u0026 Name should be unique) so it can be searched and discovered in the PHR app.\nCheck your configuration For detailed APIs related to registration with the ABDM gateway\nhttps://sandbox.abdm.gov.in/swagger/ndhm-devservice.yaml\nABDM HTTP Headers A single ABDM Client (also called a Bridge) can support multiple HIPs / HIUs on the same registered URL. In order to clearly identify which HIP / HIU this message was intented to be sent, the Gateway adds the following headers as part its API calls\nThe X-HIP-ID Header – Contains the health facility registry code that is linked to the Client ID The X-HIU-ID Header – Contains the health information user code that is linked to this Client ID The ABDM architecture is designed to support multiple HIE-CMs. Whenever you call any Gateway API you must include a header that tells the gateway which HIE-CM must this request be sent to\nX-CM-ID – Pass ‘sbx’ if you are in the sandbox, Pass ‘abdm’ if you are in production. You must get this from HIE-CM domain name suffixed after the @ symbol in a PHR address. Use Webhook to learn APIs We recommend using a combination of Postman \u0026 webhook to quickly understand ABDM APIs. Use your postman collection and ensure your async callbacks are working in sandbox\nGo to https://webhook.site Copy your unique URL (which would be your callback url) shown on the page Register it with ABDM Gateway. Ensure you get a Response: 200 Link a HIP / HIU ID of your choice to your client id. Ensure you get a Response: 200 Create a Sandbox ABHA address at https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in Call an async Gateway API like /v0.5/users/auth/fetch-modes with the @sbx ABHA address Verify you get a callback (like /v0.5/users/auth/on-fetch-modes) at your webhook site.

Patient does not share any ABHA Address with the facility. If the Health Facility is participating in ABDM, then it will notify ABDM when there is a new health record for this patient. Only the mobile number and the ID of the facility is notified. Facilities are identified by the facility’s HIPCODE. This can be obtained by registering the facility using the Health Facility Registry and linking the facility to a ABDM approved Health Repository Provider Software. ABDM will send an SMS to the user with a deep link. The content of the message will be: (insert message content)\nClicking on the link will show the list of all ABHA Mobile Applications that have cleared functional and security testing in the ABDM sandbox and have been production approved. Note The list of apps are presented in a random order each time the link is opened. The list of apps displayed is specific to the OS – Android or IOS\nSelecting an app will launch the app if already installed on the device or take the user to the play store (android) / app store (ios) to download the app. The deep link passed to the app in both scenarios contains the HIPCODE. The ABHA Mobile Application will help new users to register and create a ABHA Address using their name, date of birth, gender and mobile. The ABHA Mobile Application must recognize the invocation was via a Deep Link. It must initiate a Discovery request to the HIPCODE that was part of the deep link. The Discovery API is implemented by ABHA Mobile Applications to find health records at a health facility. It is important for the ABHA Mobile Application to guide the user to provide the same Name, DoB, Gender and Mobile number that was provided to the Health Facility. If there is any difference in this information, the record cannot be retrieved correctly. ABDM will forward the Discovery request from the ABHA Mobile Application to the participating Health Facility. The Discovery request consists of the ABHA Address (chosen by the user), Name, DoB, Gender and Mobile Number. The Health facility will search for any health records for this combination. If it finds a record it will respond to the ABHA Mobile Application with the available records listed in the form of care contexts. The ABHA Mobile Application should be able to display this to the user, link the care context to the ABHA Address, collect the appropriate consent from the user, fetch the health record(s) from the facility and display it to the user. Process to enable Deep Link support to your ABHA Mobile Application\nThe ABHA Mobile Application must submit the following information to ABDM as part of Sandbox exit. Send an email to abdm.sandbox@nha.gov.in with the following details (eg here is AarogyaSetu)\nName of the App: AarogyaSetu Play Store Link App Store Link Android Intent URI: uhi://discover?hip=‘HIPCODE’ iOS Intent URI: arogya://discover?hip=‘HIPCODE’ Logo for your App: Share file as an attachment Please note that for this version of the deep linking release there is some flexibility provided in the intent URI and you each ABHA Mobile Application can define its format. It is mandatory for all intent URIs to accept the HIPCODE. Here’s a tip for implementors:\nFor Android implementors For iOS implementors Demonstrating your Deep Link support during Sandbox Exit\nGet the team to configure your ABHA Mobile Application correctly on the sandbox implementation site at phrsbx.adbm.gov.in. if you are providing your application as an APK for sideloading note that only the “already installed” test case can be verified.\nThe EMRSBX application available at https://emrsbx.abdm.gov.in/ has been updated to support the deep linking flow.\nLogin to EMRSBX. Register a new patient without providing a ABHA Address - Just use Name, DoB, Gender and a Mobile for the registration. Add a new Health record to this patient. You will get a notification SMS on the mobile with a deep link. The deeplink URI will point to phrsbx.adbm.gov.in/uhi/‘HIPCODE’. App should behave correctly as defined in this document for both user cases. New User - who downloads, installs and creates a ABHA Address Already installed App user When you launch the PHR app, it starts with a log-on page or the home page for a logged in user. ABDM requires the PHR app to start at a different page if invoked with a specific intent. This can be described in 2 scenarios:\nScenario 1\nQR Code at Facility is scanned using 3rd party camera app. This triggers a link (PHR | ABDM ) and lists the compatible PHR apps On selecting the PHR app, the PHR app is invoked with a specific intent. The App is expected to directly go to the share profile page pre-filled with the facility to share the profile Scenario 2\nUser has not shared the ABHA address at the health facility. HF triggers an SMS notification with a deep link to the user’s mobile number when a new health record is created. The link looks like phr.abdm.gov.in/uhi/. On clicking the link, a list of compatible PHR applications is displayed. On selecting the PHR app, the app is invoked wiht the specific intent. The App is expected to go directly to the discovery and link page and pre-filled with the facility from which to discover recods.
