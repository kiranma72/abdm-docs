# ABDM Docs - README

This is the repository for the new ABDM sandbox documentation currently under development. 
You can preview the documentation produced by this repo at [https://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs](https://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs)

If you want to contribute to improving the documentation, write with your github id to kiranma@gmail.com and we will add you as a collabrator to this project 

## For contributors

- This documentation uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to build the final documentation site. 
- We recommend [installing hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) on your local machine if you are making changes across multiple pages 
- You can clone this directory to your system using git clone --recursive https://github.com/kiranma72/abdm-docs/ 
- The folder structure is very important. All pages are under the directory "content". 
- Familiarize your self with how [Hugo organizes content](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/)
- Each folder under content represents a chapter
- The _index.md page contains the content for the chapter's starting page
- You can add as many pages to a chapter or create a new folder to create a sub-chapter
- The order of the pages are controlled by the "weight" parameter in the header of each page
- All pages are written using Markdown - Editor: [dillinger markdown editor](https://dillinger.io) and [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is recommended for use to edit Markdown content on your local system
- The content uses [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for sequence diagrams. If you change the theme ensure it supports mermaid 
- Put images and other resources under the static folder. If you add to static folder reference your image using a path like /abdm-docs/img/<filename>
- Put images in the same content folder as the page your are editing. Reference the image using the path ../<filename> 
- Use  {{< gallery dir="folder name"  \>}} shortcode for a carousel of images. Full path from Content must be specified for folder. eg: 1-basics/<foldername>. This is based on [hugo-easy-gallery](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery)
- Set theme to 'green' in config.toml for customizations
