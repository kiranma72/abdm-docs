  title: Health Repository Provider Specifications for HIP
  description: >
    The following are the specifications for the APIs to be implemented at the Health Repository end if an entity is only serving the role of a HIP. The specs are essentially duplicates from the Gateway and Health Repository, but put together so as to make it clear to *HIPs* which set of APIs they should implement to participate in the network.

      1. The APIs are organized by the flows - **discovery**, **link**, **consent flow**, **data flow**, **user auth** and **monitoring**. They represent the APIs that are expected to be available at the HIP end by the Gateway.
      2. For majority of the APIs, there are corresponding callback APIs on the Gateway. e.g for **/care-context/discover** API on HIP end, its expected that a corresponding callback API **/care-context/on-discover** on Gateway is called. Such APIs are organized under the **Gateway** label.
      3. Gateway relevant APIs for HIPs are grouped under **Gateway** label. These include the APIs that HIPs may require to call on the Gateway. For example, to notify a CM that requested data is transferred, HIP would call **/health-information/notify** API on gateway. Or for example, to get a session or to do a hip-initiated purpose for linking care-contexts.
      4. APIs under **data transfer** are meant to be implemented by the HIU. However, these have been marked here to give indication to the HIPs about the data contract.
      5. **NOTE**, in some of the API documentations below, **X-HIU-ID** is mentioned in header (for example in /auth/on-init). These are the cases, when a particular API is applicable for both HIU and HIP (e.g an entity is playing the role of HRP representing both HIU and HIP). If you are only playing the role of HIP, then only X-HIP-ID header will be sent

      description: >
        **NOTE**: This API is actually the callback URL that is passed as **dataPushUrl** in the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. This API is directly called by HIP Data Bridge and is not mediated via CM, and hence not routed through the Gateway.
          1. This API should be implemented at HIU side. It maybe implemented by the Data Bridge representing the HIU.
          2. Entry elements maybe ***content*** or ***link***, although for version 1, entry ***content*** is preferred.
          3. Entry ***content*** (or even link reference content) must be encrypted by means of Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange, utilizing the HIU keymaterials that are passed through the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request.
          4. Media contains the mimetype of content, and for v1, it is "application/fhir+json"
          5. checksum is Md5 checksum of the data conent, before encryption
          6. Please refer to the NDHM Sandbox Documentation for the format of FHIR bundle that is passed through content

      summary: Response to user authentication initialization from HIP
      description: >
        If the patient's id is valid, CM will return a transactionId as initialization of user auth. If the request is valid, then 'auth.mode' will convey how the authentication should be done. The authentication can be *mediated* or *direct*. For mediated authentication modes, HIP or HIU is epected to send over relevant code (OTP/token) or demographic info via subsequent API call to /auth/confirm. for direct authentication case, CM will notify requester through/users/auth/notify API.

          1. **auth.mode** conveys whats the mode of authentication is, and what is expected from HIP/HIU in the subsequent /auth/confirm API call. Possible values
              1. MOBILE_OTP - auth via OTP to registered mobile. Mediated.
              2. AADHAAR_OTP - auth initiated with Aadhaar with OTP. Mediated.
              3. DEMOGRAPHICS - auth initiated with demographic verification
              4. DIRECT - for authentication directly with the patient. e.g. Mobile App, SMS. In this case, the HIP/HIU is not expected to call subsequent /auth/confirm call. CM will do direct authentication with the User (e.g. Mobile App, SMS etc) and will notify requester
          2. **meta.expiry** conveys the expiry time of the token and the authentication session
          3. **NOTE**, only one of **X-HIP-ID** or **X-HIU-ID** will be sent as part of header, not both.

        The error section in the body, represents the potential errors that may have occurred. Possible reasons:
          1. Patient id is invalid

      description: >
        Result of patient care-context link request from HIP end. This happens in context of previous discovery of patient found at HIP end, therefore the link requests ought to be in reference to the patient reference and care-context references previously returned by the HIP. The correlation of discovery and link request is maintained through the transactionId. HIP should have
          1. **Validated transactionId in the request to check whether there was a discovery done previously, and the link request corresponds to returned patient care care context references**
          2. **Before returning the response, HIP should have sent an authentication request to the patient(eg: OTP verification)**
          3. **HIP should communicate the mode of authentication of a successful request**
          4. **HIP subsequently should expect the token passed via /link/confirm against the link.referenceNumber passed in this call**

        The error section in the body, represents the potential errors that may have occurred. Possible reasons:
          1. **Patient reference number is invalid**
          2. **Care context reference numbers are invalid**

      summary: Confirmation request sending token, otp or other authentication details from HIP/HIU for confirmation
      description: >
        This API is called by HIP/HIUs to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned by the previous callback API /users/auth/on-init must be sent. If Authentication is successful the callback API will send an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only **credential.authCode** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
          1. demographic details are only required for  demographic auth as of now.
          2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is DEMOGRAPHICS. Usually for demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in User Account.
          3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates.
          4. credential.authCode is required for other MEDIATED authentication like MOBILE_OTP, AADHAAR_OTP.
