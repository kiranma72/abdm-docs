The Unified Health Interface (UHI) is a network where applications built on the DHP open protocol can interoperably connect with each other to provide health services. UHI is a key Digital Public Infrastructure that enables discoverability and transaction for digital health services. UHI works with other ABDM building blocks like HIE-CM for interoperable exchange of personal health data and registries like HPR &amp;amp; HFR to enable trust from participating doctors and health facilities.</description></item><item><title>UHI Architecture Overview</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/uhi/uhi_architecture_overview/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 18:00:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/uhi/uhi_architecture_overview/</guid><description>UHI Architecture UHI aims to trasnform the way digital health services are rendered in India, while ensuring that it is in sync with the other building blocks of ABDM. The functional architecture for UHI is mentioned below. The aim of this architecture is to ensure interoperability for health services and health data. The architecture also depicts how UHI will interact with the other building blocks within ABDM.
Architecture Steps 1. A Sign Up/ Login: Patients login using their ABHA number/ Aadhar number.</description></item><item><title>Registrating your UHI app</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/uhi/uhi_sandbox_registry/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 18:00:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/uhi/uhi_sandbox_registry/</guid><description>The UHI Registry Before your EUA or HSPA app can talk to other UHI apps, you must first add it into the UHI registry.
Go to the Sandbox webpage at https://sandbox.abdm.gov.in/
If you have already signed up for the Sandbox use the link for existing ABDM partners https://sandbox.abdm.gov.in/applications/Home/signup_form_UHI
If you are new to the ABDM sandbox, ensure you select if you want to build an UHI EUA or UHI HSPA or both.</description></item><item><title>Sandbox Gateway, EUA &amp; HSPA</title><link>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/uhi/uhi_sandbox_gw/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 18:00:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/uhi/uhi_sandbox_gw/</guid><description>The UHI Gateway on Sandbox ABDM is operating a UHI gateway as part of its sandbox. This gateway can be used by UHI app developers to build and test their apps.
Every Application accessing the gateway must first register itself in the UHI registry on Sandbox. The UHI gateway does not have any web interface. It merely responds to the search / on_search request from UHI applications.
