      summary: Response to user authentication initialization from HIP
      description: >
        If the patient's id is valid, CM will return a transactionId as initialization of user auth. If the request is valid, then 'auth.mode' will convey how the authentication should be done. The authentication can be *mediated* or *direct*. For mediated authentication modes, HIP or HIU is epected to send over relevant code (OTP/token) or demographic info via subsequent API call to /auth/confirm. for direct authentication case, CM will notify requester through/users/auth/notify API. 
        
          1. **auth.mode** conveys whats the mode of authentication is, and what is expected from HIP/HIU in the subsequent /auth/confirm API call. Possible values 
              1. MOBILE_OTP - auth via OTP to registered mobile. Mediated. 
              2. AADHAAR_OTP - auth initiated with Aadhaar with OTP. Mediated. 
              3. DEMOGRAPHICS - auth initiated with demographic verification
              4. DIRECT - for authentication directly with the patient. e.g. Mobile App, SMS. In this case, the HIP/HIU is not expected to call subsequent /auth/confirm call. CM will do direct authentication with the User (e.g. Mobile App, SMS etc) and will notify requester
          2. **meta.expiry** conveys the expiry time of the token and the authentication session
          3. **NOTE**, only one of **X-HIP-ID** or **X-HIU-ID** will be sent as part of header, not both. 
        
        The error section in the body, represents the potential errors that may have occurred. Possible reasons:
          1. Patient id is invalid

        This API is called by HIP/HIUs to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned by the previous callback API /users/auth/on-init must be sent. If Authentication is successful the callback API will send an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only **credential.authCode** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
          1. demographic details are only required for  demographic auth as of now. 
          2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is DEMOGRAPHICS. Usually for demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in User Account.
          3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates. 
          4. credential.authCode is required for other MEDIATED authentication like MOBILE_OTP, AADHAAR_OTP.

      summary: notification API in case of DIRECT mode of authentication by the CM
      description: >
        This API is called by CM to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned is same as that passed in /auth/on-init. The "auth.status" conveys whether the request was GRANTED or DENIED.
        
          1. **auth.accessToken** - is specific to the purpose mentioned in the /auth/init. This token needs to be used for initiating the intended action. For example for HIP initiated linking of care-contexts
          2. **NOTE**, only one of **X-HIP-ID** or **X-HIU-ID** will be sent as part of header, not both.
          3. The payload is conditional to the purpose of auth. If purpose specified in /auth/init is KYC or KYC_AND_LINK, then patient details are passed. **auth.accessToken** is passed only if the purpose is LINK or KYC_AND_LINK.
      parameters:
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/authorization"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/X-HIP-ID"
